## Business Model

- Customers access Instacart’s platform via website or app. Whenever an order is placed on the platform, the so-called personal shoppers in proximity will receive a notification of the request. These shoppers are independent contractors, and they receive by delivery made. Once a shopper accepts the request, they drive to the grocery store chosen, pick up the groceries and deliver them to the customer’s address.
#### Revenue Stream
- Commissions
  - Every time an item is sold through Instacart’s platform, the company receives a percentage of the price, according to the agreement made with the retailer. In some cases, Instacart even sells some products at a higher price to increase markup.
- Delivery and Service Fees (Price Discrimination)
  - Delivery fees vary from USD 3.99 - 9.99. Because Instacart, just like other platforms, such as Uber or Lyft, charges according to the demand and external conditions (such as the weather), the so-called surge pricing. And also due to shipment scheduling. These fees are distributed between the store and Instacart. The service fees (mark-up prices) get around 5% to 10% of the purchase. Sometimes, there are additional fees, for example, when an order surpasses a certain weight threshold or when there is a bag fee.
- Subscription
  - The company has the Instacart Express. It is a subscription service that ensures unlimited deliveries (or orders above USD 35), cheaper service fees, and no surge pricing for an annual (USD 99) or monthly fee (USD 9.99).
